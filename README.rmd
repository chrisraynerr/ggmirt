This package extends the great R-package [`mirt`](https://github.com/philchalmers/mirt) (Multidimensional item response theory; Chalmers, 2021) with functions for creating publication-ready and customizable figures. Although the `mirt`-packages already includes possibilities to plot various aspects relevant to understanding IRT analyses (e.g., item plots, trace-plots, etc.), it does not employ `ggplot2`, which provides more flexibility and customizability. This package provides some functions to recreate such plots with ggplot2. 

**Please note:** This package is still under development. It is currently rather a place where I dump some functions that I use often, but I have not fully tested them under different scenarios and with different type of models. If you are interested in contributing, feel free to reach out.  


### Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("masurp/ggmirt")
```


### Usage

```{r, message=F, warning = F, fig.width=7, fig.height=8.5}
# Load packages
library(mirt)
library(ggmirt)

# Get some data
data <- expand.table(LSAT7)

# Run IRT model with mirt
mod <- mirt(data, 1)

# Plot item-person map
itempersonMap(mod)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot trace lines (item characteristic curves)
tracePlot(mod, data)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot trace lines (item characteristic curves)
itemInfoPlot(mod, data)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot scale characteristic curve
scaleCharPlot(mod)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot test information curves
testInfoPlot(mod)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot item infit and outfit statistics
itemfitPlot(mod)
```


```{r, message=F, warning = F}
# Plot person fit
personfitPlot(mod)
```

Next to individual plot functions, there is also a comprehensive summaryPlot()-function, which provides a lot of information about IRT models with just a line of code.

```{r, message=F, warning = F, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
summaryPlot(mod, data, theta_range = c(-5, 4), adj_factor = 4)
```
